# Bitbucket Pipelines migrations powered by GitHub Actions Importer

These instructions will guide you through configuring the GitHub Codespaces environment that you will use in these labs to learn how to use GitHub Actions Importer to migrate from Bitbucket Pipelines to GitHub Actions.

These steps **must** be completed prior to starting other labs.

## Create your own repository for these labs

- Ensure that you have created a repository using [actions/importer-labs](https://github.com/actions/importer-labs) as a template.

## Configure your codespace

1. Start a new codespace

    - Click the `Code` button on your repository's landing page.
    - Click the `Codespaces` tab.
    - Click `Create codespaces on main` to create the codespace.
    - After the codespace has initialized there will be a terminal present.

2. Verify the GitHub Actions Importer CLI is installed and working. More information on the GitHub Actions Importer extension for the official GitHub CLI can be found [here](https://github.com/github/gh-actions-importer).

    - Run the following command in the codespace terminal:

      ```bash
      gh actions-importer version
      ```

    - Verify the output is similar to below.

      ```console
      $ gh actions-importer version
      gh version 2.31.0 (2023-06-20)
      gh actions-importer	github/gh-actions-importer	v1.3.3
      actions-importer/cli       unknown
      ```

    - If `gh actions-importer version` did not produce similar output, please refer to the [troubleshooting section](#troubleshoot-the-github-actions-importer-cli).

## Labs for Bitbucket

Perform the following labs to learn more about Actions migrations with GitHub Actions Importer:

1. [Configure credentials for GitHub Actions Importer](1-configure.md)
2. [Perform an audit on Bitbucket](2-audit.md)
3. [Forecast potential build runner usage](3-forecast.md)
4. [Perform a dry-run migration of a Bitbucket pipeline](4-dry-run.md)
5. [Use custom transformers to customize GitHub Actions Importer's behavior](5-custom-transformers.md)
6. [Perform a production migration of a Bitbucket pipeline](6-migrate.md)

## Troubleshoot the GitHub Actions Importer CLI

The CLI extension for GitHub Actions Importer can be manually installed by following these steps:

- Verify you are in the codespace terminal
- Run this command from within the codespace terminal:

  ```bash
  gh extension install github/gh-actions-importer
  ```

- Verify the result of the install contains:

  ```console
  $ gh extension install github/gh-actions-importer
  âœ“ Installed extension github/gh-actions-importer
  ```

- Verify GitHub Actions Importer CLI extension is installed and working by running the following command from the codespace terminal:

  ```bash
  gh actions-importer version
  ```
