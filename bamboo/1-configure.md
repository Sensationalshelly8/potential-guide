# Configure credentials for GitHub Actions Importer

In this lab, you will use the `configure` CLI command to set the required credentials and information for GitHub Actions Importer to use when working with Bamboo and GitHub.

You will need to complete all of the setup instructions [here](./readme.md#configure-your-codespace) prior to performing this lab.

## Configuring credentials

1. Create a GitHub personal access token (PAT):
   - Open github.com in a new browser tab.
   - In the top right corner of the UI, click your profile photo and then click `Settings`.
   - In the left panel, click `Developer Settings`.
   - Click `Personal access tokens` and then `Tokens (classic)` (if present).
   - Click `Generate new token` and then `Generate new token (classic)`. You may be required to authenticate with GitHub during this step.
   - Name your token in the `Note` field.
   - Select the following scope: `workflow`.
   - Click `Generate token`.
   - Copy the generated PAT and save it in a safe location.

2. Run the `configure` CLI command:
      - Select the `TERMINAL` tab from within the codespace terminal.
      - Run the following command: `gh actions-importer configure`.
      - Use the down arrow key to highlight `Bamboo`, press the spacebar to select, and then press enter to continue.
      - At the GitHub PAT prompt, enter the GitHub PAT generated in step 2 and press enter.
      - At the GitHub URL prompt, enter the GitHub instance URL or press enter to accept the default value (`https://github.com`).
      - At the Bamboo token prompt, enter the access token from step 1 and press enter.
      - At the Bamboo URL prompt, enter your Bamboo URL.

## Verify your environment

To verify your environment is configured correctly, run the `update` CLI command. The `update` CLI command will download the latest version of GitHub Actions Importer to your codespace.

1. In the codespace terminal, run the following command:

   ```bash
   gh actions-importer update
   ```

2. You should see a confirmation that you were logged into the GitHub Container Registry and the image was updated to the latest version.

   ```console
   $ gh actions-importer update
   Updating ghcr.io/actions-importer/cli:latest...
   ghcr.io/actions-importer/cli:latest up-to-date
   ```
